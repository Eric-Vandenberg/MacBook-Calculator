# MacBook-Calculator

#  This is a free open-sourced Basic GUI Calculator
#  It was designed to look like the backdrop application of a macbook pro
#  The initial design was closely modeled after the CSS design writen by #(************)
#  Changes made to .macbook code included: scaling up x4
#                                          designing button in place for future flip down/up animation
#                                          modifying screen size and other dimensions/design elements to more closely resemble a 2012-2015 MacBook Pro

#                     Advanced GUI functions:
#                         Creating more advanced math capabilities with the following new buttons:
#                             x^y     i.e.    x<sup>y</sup>
#                             %       i.e.    &#37;
#                             squareroot i.e. &radic;

#
#
#                     Animations:
#                         Fully animated screen that opens on the Z plane and toggles animation on the press of the button
#                         Potentially more hover animations or onclick animations to give the calculator more of a physical feel
