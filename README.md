# MacBook-Calculator
#  This is a free open-sourced Basic GUI Calculator
#
#  It was designed to look like the backdrop application of a macbook pro
#  The initial design was closely modeled after the CSS design writen by #(************)
#  Changes made to .macbook code included: scaling up x4
#                                          designing button in place for future flip down/up animation
#                                          modifying screen size and other dimensions/design elements to more closely resemble a 2012-2015 MacBook Pro 
#  The Calculator
#         
#           Current Functions:
#
#                     Basic GUI functions:
#                         Ability to input endless string of numbers and operators NOTE: The calculator does not know which math function to apply first/next. i.e. pararenthesis are not available yet
#                         Ability to handle basic math input and return a quick result
#                     
#                     
#           Future Functionality:
#                     
#                     Advanced GUI functions:
#                         Creating more advanced math capabilities with the following new buttons:
#                             x^y     i.e.    x<sup>y</sup>
#                             %       i.e.    &#37;
#                             squareroot i.e. &radic;
#                             etc.
#
#
#                     Animations:
#                         Fully animated screen that opens on the Z plane and toggles animation on the press of the button
#                         Potentially more hover animations or onclick animations to give the calculator more of a physical feel
#
#March 1st, 2015 Version 0.3.0 is now complete with full basic functionality
# The plus/minus button was programmed to take the last integer entered and make it negative
#   Note: If a person attempts to make a number negative BEFORE entering the number they will be prompted with a quick alert tip that reads "First, enter the number you want to make negative, then press Â±"
#
#
#More recent changes included converting the power button to a toggle functionality
#A small gradient toggle change occurs on each click of this toggle button
# Future animations will include a life-like visual of the calculator program fading out and the computer screen blacking out
